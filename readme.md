# ProxNut: Cashu Proxy for Web Requests

**ProxNut** is a Cashu proxy designed to protect or monetize web resources. Seamlessly integrate with a Cashu ecash wallet, allowing users to access protected resources using tokens.

## üåü Features

- **Ecash Wallet Integration**: Seamlessly top up and spend tokens.
- **Resource Protection**: Protect and monetize your web resources with ease.
- **Open-Source**: Join our community and contribute to the project.

## üõ† Installation

While the project is still in progress, you can test it using the code in the `bun` folder. For a comprehensive installation guide, including using Docker Compose and manual setup, refer to our [technical documentation](https://github.com/gandlafbtc/proxnut/wiki/).

## üîÑ How It Works

ProxNut forwards requests only if they have a valid Cashu token attached to the X-Cashu header. Configuration options include mapping hosts, routes, setting fees, and specifying allowed mints.

## ‚öô Configuration

This proxy forwards requests only if they have a valid cashu token attached to the X-Cashu header. Configuration on mapping routes and how expensive routes are, can be made in the `dashboard`. You can also configure the allowed mints there.

- **Route Mapping**: Define how requests are routed and the associated fees.
- **Mints**: Add mints you run. Note: Currently, you can only use mints you run yourself due to the absence of a swap-out function for the proxy.

For detailed configuration instructions, check the [technical documentation](https://github.com/gandlafbtc/proxnut/wiki/).

## üöÄ Usage

Run the entire stack with Docker Compose or manually. The provided demo backend offers both unprotected and protected resources for testing.


### How to run

The whole stack can be run with docker compose: 

1. `docker-compose up --build` 

this will run the applications on the following ports:

1. `frontend` on port `8080`
1. `proxnut` on port `3003`
1. `backend` on port `4444`


or you can use the manual setup:

1. install bun: 
```curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash```
1. run the proxy: ```bun run start```
1. if you haven't configured a backend yourself in the chapters above, there is a simple test server in the deno folder that is pre-configured. to run it, install deno: `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh` - and then run the demo backend:  `deno run --allow-net --watch deno/server.ts`


On the demo backend, there is a unprotected resources, that routes freely (`/`) and there is a protected resource (`/test`) that asks for 1 satoshi per request.

### Adding protected resources

Access the dashboard at: http://localhost:5515 . Here you can add a route that the proxy should forward. Make sure to include the local network host in the route you wish to route to!

> from: `/some/route` ---> to: `http://localhost:4444/1` | fee: 1


### Adding mints
Finally, you can add the mints that you allow. 

To add a mint, head to the dashboard at http://localhost:5515 and add a mint.

### Integrate into frontend

here is an example on how to integrate proxnut into your frontend with the proxnut-wallet web component:
